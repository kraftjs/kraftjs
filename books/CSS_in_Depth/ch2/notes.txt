absolute units: px, mm, cm, in, pt, pc
relative units: em, rem, vh, vw, vmin, vmax

CSS has to accomadate browser windows of many different sizes, and CSS has to
adjust. Responsive design is the solution.

In CSS 1 em means the font size of the current element. They can be convenient
when setting properties like padding, height, width, or border-radius. If ems
are defined by the current element's font size, then what happens if you dec-
lare `font-size: 1.2em;` A font size can't equal 1.2 times itself; instead,
font-size ems are derived from the inherited font size.

* It's helpful to know that, for most browsers, the default font size is 16px.

The browser first calculates an elements font-size before using it to calculate
other relative values.

Ems are nice for padding, margins, and element sizing, but when it comes to
font size, they can get complicated. Thankfully, there is a better option--rems.

Rem is short for root em. Instead of being relative to the current element, rems
are relative to the root telement. No matter where you apply it in the document,
1.2 rem has the same computed value: 1.2 times the font size of the root element.

Viewport-relative units define lengths relative to the browser's viewport--the
framed area in the browser window where the web page is visible, excluding the
browser's address bar, toolbars, and status bar.
