Summary:
1) Use fixed position for modal dialogs.
2) Use absolute positioning for dropdown menus, tooltips, and other dynamic
   interaction.
3) Be aware of accessibility concerns when building these features.
4) There are two gotchas of z-index: it only works on positioned elements and
   using it creates a new stacking context.
5) Sticky positioning is new and combines fixed and relative positioning. Keep
   an eye out for better browser support.
