Inherited properties (not comprehensive, but nearly):
color, font, font-family, font-size,
font-weight, font-variant, font-style,
line-height, letter-spacing, text-align, text-indent,
text-transform, white-space, word-spacing, list-style,
list-style-type, list-style-position, list-style-image,
border-collapse, and border-spacing.


Summary:
- Keep selector specificity under control.
- Don't confuse cascade with inheritance.
- Some properties are inherited, i.e. text, lists, and table borders.
- Don't confuse 'initial' aand 'auto' values.
- Stay out of TRouBLe with shorthand properties.
