Applying `display: flex` to an element turns it into a flex container, and its
children turn into flex items. By default, flex items align side by side, left
to right, all in one row. The flex container fills the available width like a
block element, but the flex items may not necessarily fill the width of their
flex container. The flex items are all the same height, determined naturally by
their contents.

The flex property controls the size of the flex items along the main axis (that
is the width).
