Base styles should be fairly generic. Only add styles here that you want
applied to most or all of the page. There should be no class names or IDs in
your selectors, so you only target elements by their tag type and the
occaisional pseudo-class. The idea is that these styles provide the global look
you want, but are easy to override later when you need to.
