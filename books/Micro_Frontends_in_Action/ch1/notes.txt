Micro Frontends:
Vertically arranged teams; each system is autonomous, which means it can 
function even when the neighboring systems are down. Every system has its own
data store to achieve this. Additionally, it doesnâ€™t rely on synchronous calls 
to other systems to answer a request.

Every team should have a descriptive name and a clear user-focused mission.

Teams are independent and free to choose frameworks and libraries that align
with their goals. They don't share code and can update their dependencies.
