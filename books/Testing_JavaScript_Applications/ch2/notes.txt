End-to-end tests validate the application from the user's perspective.
Integration tests validate how different pieces of software work together.
Unit tests validate functions.

Tests follow the pattern: setup, execution, verification OR arrange, act, assert.

Integration tests help you ensure that the different parts of your software can 
work together. For example, they help you validate whether your software 
communicates appropriately with third-party RESTful APIs, or whether it can 
manipulate items in a database.

You want tests to fail only when a function's observable behavior changes.
