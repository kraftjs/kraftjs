/* public, protected, private modifiers
 *
 * public: Class members marked as public can be accessed from the internal
 * class methods as well as from external scripts. This is the default
 * access, so if you place the keyword public in front of a property or
 * method the accessibility of these class members wonâ€™t change.
 *
 * protected: Class members marked as protected can be accessed either from
 * the internal class code or from class descendants. Instances of the class
 * cannot access the protected members.
 *
 * private: The private class members are visible only within the class.
